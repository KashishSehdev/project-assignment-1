                            mobile computing and cloud computing, has become one of
                            the industry buzz words and a major discussion thread in the
                            IT world since 2009. As MCC is still at the early stage of
                            development, it is necessary to grasp a thorough understanding
                            of the technology in order to point out the direction of future
                            research. With the latter aim, this paper presents a review on
                            the background and principle of MCC, characteristics, recent
                            research work, and future research trends. A brief account on the
                            background of MCC: from mobile computing to cloud computing
                            is presented and then followed with a discussion on characteristics
                            and recent research work. It then analyses the features and
                            infrastructure of mobile cloud computing. The rest of the paper
                            analyses the challenges of mobile cloud computing, summary
                            of some research projects related to this area, and points out
                            promising future research directions. <br>

                            Over the past few years, advances in the field of network
                            based computing and applications on demand have led to
                            an explosive growth of application models such as cloud
                            computing, software as a service, community network, web
                            store, and so on. As a major application model in the era of the
                            Internet, Cloud Computing has become a significant research
                            topic of the scientific and industrial communities since 2007.
                            Commonly, cloud computing is described as a range of services which are provided by an Internet-based cluster system.
                            Such cluster systems consist of a group of low-cost servers or
                            Personal Computers (PCs), organizing the various resources
                            of the computers according to a certain management strategy,
                            and offering safe, reliable, fast, convenient and transparent
                            services such as data storage, accessing and computing to
                            clients. According to the top ten strategic technology trends
                            for 2012 [1] provided by Gartner (a famous global analytical
                            and consulting company), cloud computing has been on the
                            top of the list, which means cloud computing will have an
                            increased impact on the enterprise and most organizations in
                            2012. <br>
                            Meanwhile, smartphones are considered as the representative for the various mobile devices as they have been connected
                            to the Internet with the rapidly growing of wireless network
                            technology. Ubiquity and mobility are two major features</p>

                            in the next generation network which provides a range of
                            personalized network services through numerous network terminals and modes of accessing. The core technology of cloud
                            computing is centralizing computing, services, and specific
                            applications as a utility to be sold like water, gas or electricity
                            to users. Thus, the combination of a ubiquities mobile network and cloud computing generates a new computing mode,
                            namely Mobile Cloud Computing. <br>
                            As an inheritance and development of cloud computing,
                            resources in mobile cloud computing networks are virtualized
                            and assigned in a group of numerous distributed computers
                            rather than in traditional local computers or servers, and are
                            provided to mobile devices such as smartphones, portable terminal, and so on. (see Fig. 1). Meanwhile, various applications
                            based on mobile cloud computing have been developed and
                            served to users, such as Googles Gmail, Maps and Navigation
                            systems for Mobile, Voice Search, and some applications on
                            an Android platform, MobileMe from Apple, Live Mesh from
                            Microsoft, and MotoBlur from Motorola. According to the
                            research from Juniper, the cloud computing based mobile
                            software and application are expected to rise 88% annually
                            from 2009 to 2014, and such growth may create US 9.5 billion
                            dollars in 2014.
